# About Me

Here is **Yunpeng(Nick) Chu**

I am a junior undergraduate student at Stony Brook University majoring in Applied Mathematics and Statistics (AMS) and Mathematics (MAT). 

Prior to Stony Brook, I worked on research related to digital/corporate finance with Professor Ruoxi Zhang and Professor Chao Zhu at Capital University of Economic and Bussiness

I am always open to academic discussions and potential collaborations. Please feel free to reach me out at **yunpeng.chu [at] stonybrook.edu**

## Research Interests
I'm interested in computational biomathematics, machine learning, and high-performance computing, focusing on interpretable and scalable methods for subgraph perturbation/anomaly detection and graph-structured change-point detection in omics networks.

- **Interpretable subgraph perturbation detection**: identifying key subnetworks and driver nodes.  
- **Scalable HPC implementations**: efficient multi-core/GPU acceleration for large-scale omics data.
